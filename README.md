# Employee-Mental-Health-Treatment-Prediction

A project to predict whether an employee in a tech company needs mental health treatment or not based on their background data acquired from their surveys. It was found that predicting mental health issues in employees in advance and seeking treatment before it became serious saved employers money (due to avoidance of absenteeism, sick leaves, etc.)

## Final Output:
The final prediction consists of 0 and 1. 0 is not needing mental health treatment and 1 is needing mental health treatment for that individual. The accuracy of the model is 73%.
